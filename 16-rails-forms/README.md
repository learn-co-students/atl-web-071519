## Rails CRUD

Morning: Rails Forms.
Afternoon: Rails Association labs and .... TIPS!
  * Technical Interview Practice Sessions

### Deliverables

* A code school app with cohorts and students.
  * Cohorts already have new/create/index/show.
  * Students need new/create/index/show/edit/update/destroy.

### Learning Objectives

* Reinforce our process: Migrations -> Models -> Routes -> Controller -> View.
* Get comfortable testing view helpers / doing `byebug` in the views.
* Practice routing and *path helpers*. (esp `a href` vs `link_to`)
  * Reminder: `localhost:3000/rails/info/routes`
* Practice views and *view helpers*. (esp `form ...` vs `form_tag` vs `form_for`)
  * Reminder: `form_authenticity_token`
* Practice using *strong params* for mass assignment.
   * Esp trying to decide `require.permit` vs `permit`.
