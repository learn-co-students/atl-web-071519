Go through JS Types (Array, Numbers, Strings, Objects)
--
Array - Collection of elements (indexed)

let foo = [1, 2, 3]
let bar = [true, 43, 'raza'] 
Numbers - Integers
Floats/double - numbers with decimals 3.14, 1.00

Strings - a collection of characters denoted by single/double quotes or backtickls

Objects - a collection of key value pairs


const person = {
  name: 'Courtney',
  age: 31
}

let key = 'age'

console.log(person.name)
console.log(person['name'])

person[key] // 31































People started making different version of Script for their own browser. This is where ECMA Script comes out. ECMAScript is the name of the standardized version of JS across all browsers

What is Node? Node is a server side runtime for js on top of V8 that included an eventloop


Explain Client-Server Model
- Client is any machine/Program that makes requests through the web
- Server is a computer program that provide functionality and serve other programs through the web
- A single server can serve multiple clients
- Different types of servers
    - Web Server (Apache) That serve http requests
    - DB Servers that run DMS
- Basically a server can hold web resources, host websites, store users and data etc.
- A server is always listening for requests
- In order for the client and server to communicate they need to have a common language to communicate over the wires. And what would that be? The http protocol

Explain The DOM
