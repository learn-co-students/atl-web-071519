#### Getting started

```javascript

 npm install -g create-react-app

 // Creating an application
 create-react-app <Application_Name>
 cd <Application_Name>

#### Import - Export
- Way to share information across files

#### Thinking about props
- Props are to components as arguments are to a function

#### Introduction to State
- Similar to an instance variable that can hold information
- Similar to an instance variable that a component can manage by itself and change over time.
- i.e. ```` Using state to hold user input! ````
